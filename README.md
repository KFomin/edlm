## REGULAR LIFE MANAGEMENT APPS

Hello, this is my collection of tools that may be useful in regular life.

### 1) Bank statement charts

#### What is does:
-[X] Parses csv file
-[X] Allows use to define columns for payment amount/recipient/date
-[X] Groups payments by payment recipient name
-[X] Builds charts, so you can visually analyse your expenses increase or decrease

#### Future features:
-[X] Store payments data in indexedDB, so we don't need to upload same csv every time
-[X] Combine many bank statements cvs in one big report, using indexedDB, so we can analyse family expenses from many statements
-[X] Combine payment groups into bigger groups, as example we can combine payments from different stores/shops
