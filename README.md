## REGULAR LIFE MANAGEMENT APPS

Hello, this is my collection of tools that may be useful in regular life.

### 1) Bank statement charts

#### What is does:
- Parses csv file
- Allows use to define columns for payment amount/recipient/date
- Groups payments by payment recipient name
- Builds charts, so you can visually analyse your expenses increase or decrease

#### Future features:
- Store payments data in indexedDB, so we don't need to upload same csv every time
- Combine many bank statements cvs in one big report, using indexedDB, so we can analyse family expenses from many statements
- Combine payment groups into bigger groups, as example we can combine payments from different stores/shops
